This step converts the Pseudo-Assembly made from the previous step to the actual target assembly.

It's very rare to encounter an error in this step and the previous one, and if so happens, it's fault falls on the compiler developers. That's why some Enterprise companies don't use open-source compilers, instead they used closed-source ones made by other corporations, so if they found an error, they can blame them :)

The Next step is either [[Optimizer]] or [[Symbol Table Generator]] depending of the compiler parameters.
