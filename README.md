# EmbeddedNotes_Obsidian
All my embedded C and Embedded systems notes made by obsidian are put here, you are free to read it. I will continuously push new information here weekly. 

# Obsidian
It's a free note taking application that uses "md-like" syntax to write notes, the special feature about it is that you can link your notes together, and can create canvases to spread-out your notes and connect them together as you like and create a new ones. 

It can be easier than a plain notebook, as it requires way less effort to connect your information on Obsidian than in a notebook, as you have to section your notebook and number each page and section/chapter carefully, and it's not very dynamic as Obsidian here, therefore I decided to write most of my notes here as they are a variety of subjects to write about that can be linked with a thin thread, even the in-between the lines, as long as you simply tag them :D

The Notes you write here individually should be short, unless you needed to include a big code, you should include it in its own note (opinion).

To download the app, you can find it from their website (here)[] for Windows, Mac and Linux, also you can find it on both Android and iOS on their Play store and Apple store, respectively.

# Additional Notes
I originally made this for myself to understand the compilation process without dropping or forgetting something in the middle, and there are lots of things to study that I may forget some of them in the way, Obsidian is one of the tools that will help me alot during this voyage.
